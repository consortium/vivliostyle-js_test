#### Covers

Specifications can be supplied if needed, but I am assuming these get made manually.

Covers need to have closed source fonts 'Gravur' and 'HISTORY' replaced with open fonts and the cover needs setting in Scribus.

Cover PDF example as required by Lightningsource PoD printers: see above
