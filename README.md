# Vivliostyle-js and Multi-format Outputs

## Goals

1. To test Vivliostyle.js as a multi-format publication software to produce publications as print-on-demand PDF, screen PDF, EPUB 3.0, Kindle .kf8, variable page and adaptive page layouts (other software workflows might be added for some formats e.g. Le-tex Transpect).
2. To create a getting started guide for Vivliostyle.js.

## What we'll do here

A. Work on two book productions of long-form scholarly texts, that would have conventionally used an Adobe Indesign workflow combined with the usual hand-cranked eBook output. The object is to get rid of this conventional inflexible workflow, where each now output format has a separate content set, meaning making corrections is a nightmare.

The books are from Mute Publishing:

  * [You Must Make Your Death Public](https://github.com/consortium/PoD_template/tree/master/original_base_resources/Chris_Kraus_indesign_files): a collection of texts and media on the work of Chris Kraus Edited by Mira Mattar, 2015

  * Reproducing Automomy by Kerstin Stakemeier & Marina Vishmidt, May 2016

B. The roadmap is first to produce a fixed layout only, intended for print-on-demand PDF. Then to add workflows for other output formats.
