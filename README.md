# Vivliostyle-js and Multi-format Outputs

## Goals

1. To test Vivliostyle.js software as a multi-format publication solution to produce ouputs such as print-on-demand PDF (fixed page), screen PDF, EPUB 3.0, Kindle .kf8, variable page and adaptive page layouts (other software workflows might be added for some formats e.g. Le-tex Transpect).
2. To create a 'getting started guide' for Vivliostyle.js.

## What we'll do here

A. Work on two book productions of long-form scholarly texts. These types of productions would have conventionally used an Adobe Indesign workflow combined with the usual hand-cranked eBook output. The object is to get rid of this conventional inflexible workflow, where each new output format has a separate content set, meaning making corrections is a nightmare.

The books are from [Mute Publishing] (http://metamute.org):

  * [You Must Make Your Death Public](https://github.com/consortium/PoD_template/tree/master/original_base_resources/Chris_Kraus_indesign_files): a collection of texts and media on the work of Chris Kraus Edited by Mira Mattar, 2015

  * Reproducing Automomy by Kerstin Stakemeier & Marina Vishmidt, released, May 2016

B. First on the roadmap is to produce a fixed layout PDF intended for print-on-demand PDF. Then to add workflows for the other output formats.

C. Produce high quality documentation, the 'getting started guide'. Our benchmark is [OpenLayers 3 documentation](http://openlayers.org/en/v3.15.1/doc/)
