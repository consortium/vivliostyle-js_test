## Pre-Production

With Vivliostyle our base document in this case is formatted in HTML 5. If you are working with a document orginating in a wordprocessor then its well worth making good use of the word processor before you move to HTML 5.

Once you have moved to HTML 5 you lose all the integrated tools in a wordprocessor; spell checking, style application, footnote ordering. The list goes on.

First to make the workflow fully F/LOSS use LibreOffice.

### Clean up you doc using Navigator

1. Remove unwanted bookmarks and links, as well as repair and review URLs
2. Check order of headers

### Install a doc cleaner plugin

Pepito Cleaner is the best http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/pepito-cleaner

This removes blank lines, spaces at end of lines, replaces common mistakes with proper characters, e.g. ellipsis
