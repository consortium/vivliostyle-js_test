With Vivliostyle.js the base document in this case is formatted in HTML 5. If you are working with a document orginating in a word processor then its well worth making good use of the word processor before you move to HTML 5. Once you have moved to HTML 5 you lose all the integrated tools in a word processor; spell checking, style editing, footnote ordering etc. The list goes on.

First to make the workflow fully F/LOSS use LibreOffice word processor.

## Word processor checklist

### Clean up you doc using Navigator

1. Remove unwanted bookmarks and links, as well as repair and review URLs
2. Check order of headers

### Install a doc cleaner plugin 'Pepito Cleaner'

Pepito Cleaner is the best http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/pepito-cleaner

This removes blank lines, find and replace styles, spaces at end of lines, replaces common mistakes with proper characters, e.g. ellipsis

### Go to Manual

1. Check all your apostophes are not prime apostophes. Find and replace.
2. Check em dashes and en dashes are being used, consult your style guide or use Chicago Manual of Style.
